## Note

- 14 dec - Officially extended code to accept different layer with different material and heigth. Test with first example on Kollar.
- [17 dec](test3/README.md) - Decided to use PEEK material. Done mixing rules homogenization. See [test3 Readme](test3/README.md)
- [18 dec](test4/README.md) - Optimized dimension and obtained post processing graphs. See also [first_test](first_test/README.md) for the unique test code. Complete first serie of test for $[-\alpha,\alpha,30,-30/0_2]_s$. Started [report](report/README.md)
- [19 dec](more_test/README.md) - Starting generalizing code to accept more cases. 

## To-Do 

* [ ] Make other test from Kollar example
* [ ] Start testing from request!!
