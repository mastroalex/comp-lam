## Note

- 14 dec - Officially extended code to accept different layer with different material and heigth. Test with first example on Kollar.
- [17 dec](test3/README.md) - Decided to use PEEK material. Done mixing rules homogenization. See [test3 Readme](test3/README.md)
- [18 dec](test4/README.md) - Optimized dimension and obtained post processing graphs. See also [first_test](first_test/README.md) for the unique test code. Complete first serie of test for $[-\alpha,\alpha,30,-30/0_2]_s$. Started [report](report/README.md)
- [19 dec](more_test/README.md) - Starting generalizing code to accept more cases. 
- [20 dec](more_test/README.md) - Added post processing visual information. Started some test. Started wrtiting report. Started some debug test --> see [debug folder](debug/README.md)
- [21 dec](debug/README.md) - Lits all question: [request](debug/request.md). Discovered markdown fig dimension comand and personalized command. 
- [22 dec](/debug/stress.md) - Talk with prof: the error was in the interpretation of the rotation matrix. Correct interpretation is **the one from Kollar**. Update all code! 
- 23 dec - Finished Ïƒ plotting, see [stress.md](debug/stress.md). Corrected file: [first_test folder](first_test/README.md) and done test.
- 24 dec - Corrected file: [more_Test folder](first_test/README.md) and done test.
- 29 dec - Continue testing. [See more_test README](more_test/FABRIC/README.md). Developed code for fabric layer (`more_test_final_fabric.nb`) and for last case of analysis (`more_test_final_last_layer.nb`).
- 30 dec - Added plot for last layer case.

## To-Do 

* [x] Make other test from Kollar example
* [x] Start testing from request!!
* [ ] TEST ALL
